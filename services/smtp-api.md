# Group SMTP API
<a name="smtp-api"></a>

**Note**: See [SMTP Relay Endpoints](index.html#header-smtp-relay-endpoints) for the SMTP client configuration needed to use SparkPost or SparkPost Elite as an SMTP relay.

Through use of the X-MSYS-API header in a message sent to SparkPost and SparkPost Elite through SMTP,
you can now specify a campaign id, metadata,
tags, IP pool, Cc, Bcc, and archive recipient lists and disable open and/or click tracking.

**Note**: To use this option you should be familiar with how to encode
options as JSON strings, as the value of the header field is a JSON object that specifies the relevant options:

```
X-MSYS-API: {"options" : {"open_tracking" : false, "click_tracking" : true},
   "metadata" : {"key" : "value"}, "tags" : ["cat", "dog"], "campaign_id" :
   "my_campaign"}
```

Click and open tracking are disabled by default in SMTP messages sent through SparkPost.  To enable click and open tracking in SMTP messages, add the X-MSYS-API header as follows:
```
X-MSYS-API: { "options" : { "open_tracking" : true, "click_tracking" : true } }
```

**Note**: Key-Value [Substitutions](substitutions-reference.html) are not supported in SMTP API.
substitution_data provided in the X-MSYS-API header will be ignored.

The fields supported in the X-MSYS-API header are as follows:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| campaign_id | string | Name of the campaign to associate with the SMTP message | no | Maximum length - 64 bytes (same restriction as the REST API) |
| metadata | JSON object | JSON key value pairs associated with the SMTP message | no | A maximum of 1000 bytes of metadata is available in click/open events. |
| cc | JSON array | Array of recipient addresses that will be included in the "Cc" header | no | A unique message with a unique tracking URL will be generated for each recipient in this list. |
| bcc | JSON array | Array of recipient addresses that will be hidden from all other recipients | no | A unique message with a unique tracking URL will be generated for each recipient in this list. |
| archive | JSON array | Array of recipient addresses that will be hidden from all other recipients | no | A unique message will be generated for each recipient in this list. The archive copy of the message contains tracking URLs identical to the recipient. For a full description, see the "What is an archive recipient?" section.|
| tags | JSON array | Array of text labels associated with the SMTP message | no | Tags are available in click/open events. Maximum number of tags is 10 per recipient, 100 system wide. |
| options | JSON object | JSON object in which SMTP API options are defined | no | For a full description, see the Options Attributes. |

## Options Attributes

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| open_tracking | boolean | Whether open tracking is enabled for this SMTP message | no | Defaults to false. |
| click_tracking | boolean | Whether click tracking is enabled for this SMTP message | no | Defaults to false. |
| transactional | boolean | Whether message is transactional or non-transactional for unsubscribe and suppression purposes (**Note:** no List-Unsubscribe header is included in transactional messages)| no | Defaults to false. |
| sandbox| boolean| Whether or not to use the sandbox sending domain ( **Note:** SparkPost only ) | no | Defaults to false. |
| skip_suppression| boolean| Whether or not to ignore customer suppression rules, for this SMTP message only. Only applicable if your configuration supports this parameter. ( **Note:** SparkPost Elite only )| no | Defaults to false. |
| ip_pool | string | The ID of a dedicated IP pool associated with your account ( **Note:** SparkPost only ).  If this field is not provided, the account's default dedicated IP pool is used (if there are IPs assigned to it).  To explicitly bypass the account's default dedicated IP pool and instead fallback to the shared pool, specify a value of "sp_shared". Please note that this option does not apply to subaccounts. | no | For more information on dedicated IPs, see the [Support Center](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2002977-dedicated-ip-addresses)
| inline_css| boolean| Whether or not to perform CSS inlining in HTML content | no | Defaults to false. |

## Sending Messages with cc, bcc, and archive Recipients

When submitting an email via SMTP that includes the X-MSYS-API header, you may specify a JSON array for cc, bcc, and archive lists.  For each address in each of these arrays, a message will be generated. Messages will be generated with the following headers: 
* It is the responsibility of the user to include their own "To" header in the body of the message.
* All messages will display the "Cc" header and the value of that header will include all addresses listed in the "cc" array.
* The "bcc" recipients will each receive a message with the "To" and "Cc" headers described above and, additionally, will see a "Bcc" header with ONLY their own recipient address as the value of the header.
* The "archive" recipients will each receive a message with the "To" and "Cc" headers described above however, they will not have a "Bcc" header.

The following are key points about reporting and tracking for cc, bcc, and archive messages:
* Each recipient (To, Cc, Bcc, and archive) is counted as a targeted message.
* A "rcpt_type" field is available during events through the Webhooks, which designates if the message was a Cc, Bcc, or archive copy.
* A "transmission_id" field is available during events through the Webhooks, which can be used to correlate the Cc, Bcc, and archive versions of the messages to one another.

**What is an archive recipient?**

Recipients in the "archive" list will receive an exact replica of the message that was sent to the RCPT TO address. In particular, any encoded links intended for the RCPT TO recipient will appear _as is_ in the archive messages.  In contrast, recipients in the "bcc" list will have links encoded specific to their address. (There will be some differences in headers such as X-MSFBL or List-Unsubscribe headers.)

For example:

```
X-MSYS-API: {

   "cc" : [ "cc_email1@corp.com", "cc_email2@corp.com" ], 
   "bcc" : [ "bcc_email1@corp.com", "bcc_email2@corp.com" ], 
   "archive" : [ "archive_email@corp.com" ], 

   "options" : {"open_tracking" : false, "click_tracking" : true},
}
```
You may not specify more than a total of 1000 total recipients in those 3 lists.

You may also specify name and email keys in the "cc" and "bcc" JSON arrays in order to produce a friendly "Cc" or "Bcc" header. For example:

```
X-MSYS-API: {
   "cc" : [
    {
    "email" : "cc_recip_1@gmail.com",
    "name" : "CC 1"
    },
    {
    "email" : "cc_recip_2@gmail.com",
    "name" : "CC 2"
    }
  ]

  "bcc" : [
    {
    "email" : "bcc_recip_1@gmail.com",
    "name" : "BCC 1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Comments on Header Length

SMTP defines a maximum line length of 1000 characters (including CRLF).  If the value of the X-MSYS-API JSON string is
longer than 998 characters, it will need to be folded across multiple lines before the message is injected.  An example
of a folded header:

```
X-MSYS-API: {"options" : {"open_tracking" : false, "click_tracking" : true},
   "metadata" : {"key" : "value"}, "tags" : ["cat", "dog"], "campaign_id" :
   "my_campaign"}
```

Be aware that when the header is unfolded on the receiving system, as per rfc2822 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt),
a single space will be added between each line of the header.

For example:

```
X-MSYS-API: {"options" : {"open_tracking" : false }, "campaign_id" : "my_awes
   ome_campaign" }
```

Will be unfolded as

```
X-MSYS-API: {"options" : {"open_tracking" : false }, "campaign_id" : "my_awes ome_campaign" }
```

Note the space that was introduced in the "my_awes ome_campaign" string.
