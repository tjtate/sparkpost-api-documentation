# Group Suppression List
<a name="suppression-list-api"></a>

A suppression list - or exclusion list, as it is sometimes called - stores a recipient's opt-out preferences. It is a list of recipient email addresses to which you do NOT want to send email. The Suppression List API is used to manage your customer-specific exclusion list entries.  An entry indicates whether the recipient requested to receive one of the following:

* Transactional and non-transactional messages from a given customer
* Transactional messages only from a given customer
* Non-transactional messages only from a given customer
* No messages from a given customer

Transactional messages are single recipient messages that are used operationally, e.g. to reset a password or confirm a purchase; while non-transactional messages are used to run email campaigns where a list of recipients are targeted, e.g. advertising a sales event.

In addition to the customer-specific exclusion list, Message Systems maintains a global suppression list across all customers.

## List Entry Attributes

## Bulk Insert/Update [/suppression-list/]

### Insert or Update List Entries [PUT]

Bulk insert or update entries in the customer-specific exclusion list by providing a JSON object, with a "recipients" key containing an array of recipients to insert or update, as the PUT request body. Maximum size of the JSON object is 50mb. At a minimum, each recipient must have a valid "email" address and at least one of the following keys: "transactional" or "non_transactional". The optional "description" key can be used to include an explanation of what type of message should be suppressed.

If the recipient entry was added to the list by Compliance, it cannot be updated.

If an email address is duplicated in a single request, only the first instance will be processed.
